                    <p>Born on a farm where the owner's family resided, Ninja has been with her for ten years, and she tried to do the best for him
                    with what limited resources she had when she moved to the nearby city Leduc. While he was with her, she fed him raw meat, 
                    supplementing with taurine, dried meat treats, and dried sardines. Sadly, since he spent six years on a farm, he was never happy 
                    being an indoor only cat, and she was forced to rehome him to a friend's farm.</p>
