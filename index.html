            <h4>Lyme Disease</h4>
            <!-- Lyme disease article - placeholder text below -->
            <p>In 2018, the reported number of Lyme disease cases decreased to 9 compared to 18 cases in 2017 (Figure 25.1). The fluctuation in incidence from year 
            to year may be due to the low number of reported cases.<br>
            All of the reported cases were lab-confirmed. Three cases were caused by the European strains of the bacterium that causes Lyme disease which means 
            these people were likely infected in Europe. Based on reported travel history, four addi- tional cases likely acquired their illness outside of BC but 
            within North America. Based on this, it is believed that two or 22% of cases were exposed in BC.<br>
            Most cases were reported in the summer and fall months, consistent with tick season. The highest number of cases was reported among adults over
            25.1 Lyme Disease Rate by Year, 2009-2018 the age of 40 years. The highest incidence was reported from North Shore/Coast Garibaldi HSDA however all 
            these cases acquired their illness outside of BC.<br>
            The majority of ticks that carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease are found in southwestern BC, including Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, the 
            Sunshine Coast, Greater Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley. The geographic distribution of human Lyme disease and B. burgdorferi in ticks in BC has 
            remained constant.</p></div>

                    <p>Born on a farm where the owner's family resided, Ninja has been with her for ten years, and she tried to do the best for him
                    with what limited resources she had when she moved to the nearby city Leduc. While he was with her, she fed him raw meat, 
                    supplementing with taurine, dried meat treats, and dried sardines. Sadly, since he spent six years on a farm, he was never happy 
                    being an indoor only cat, and she was forced to rehome him to a friend's farm.</p>
